# DESImplement
Simplified DES (Data Encryption Standard) Implementation in pure Python language for performance and 
cross-platform integration reasons.This project requires only Python Interpretor to run this pure 
python-based program for S-DES!
This code requires a fixed 8-Bit key while performing all the core steps for S-DES i.e.
*Padding
*Permutations
*Key Schedule (via Recurrsion)
*Feistal function (via recursion)
*16 Rounds for Encryption and Decryption
Moreover this takes the input (Secret Key and Plaintext) in ASCII (UTF-8) and also displays the output 
in same format. This version is totally based upon the standard definitions of Simplified Data Encryption
Standard!
